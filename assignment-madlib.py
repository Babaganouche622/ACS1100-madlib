# This is the introduction speech in Elden Ring:


# The fallen leaves tell a story.
# The great Elden Ring was shattered.
# In our home, across the fog, the Lands Between.
# Now, Queen Marika the Eternal is nowhere to be found,
# and in the Night of the Black Knives, Godwyn the Golden was the first to perish.
# Soon, Marika's offspring, demigods all, claimed the shards of the Elden Ring.
# The mad taint of their newfound strength triggered the Shattering.
# A war from which no lord arose.
# A war leading to abandonment by the Greater Will.
# Arise now, ye Tarnished.
# Ye dead, who yet live.
# The call of long-lost grace speaks to us all.
# Hoarah Loux, chieftan of the badlands.
# The ever-brilliant Goldmask.
# Fia, the Deathbed Companion.
# The loathsome Dung Eater.
# And Sir Gideon Ofnir, the All-knowing.
# And one other. Whom grace would again bless.
# A Tarnished of no renown.
# Cross the fog, to the Lands Between.
# To stand before the Elden Ring.
# And become the Elden Lord.
